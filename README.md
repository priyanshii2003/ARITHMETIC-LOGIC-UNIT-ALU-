##DESCRIPTION* : Task 1 focuses on the design and simulation of a basic 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL to demonstrate fundamental digital design concepts. The ALU is designed to perform both arithmetic and logical operations, including addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, and bitwise NOT, based on a 3-bit selection control signal. It takes two 4-bit inputs and produces a 4-bit output, with the functionality implemented using a combinational `always @(*)` block and a case statement to ensure immediate response to input changes without the use of a clock. A dedicated testbench is developed to apply different input values and selection signals, enabling functional verification of each operation. The design is simulated on EDA Playground using the Icarus Verilog simulator, and waveform analysis is performed through EPWave by generating a VCD file to observe and validate the output behavior for all supported operations. The successful simulation and waveform results confirm the correct working of the ALU, and all related Verilog source files, testbench code, and simulation evidence are organized and uploaded to a GitHub repository as part of the task deliverables.
